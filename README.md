# SparkAR_FaceWorkshop
Spark AR Creators Day 2021 Workshop

## Workshop Description
Join me in an interactive class in which we will learn all the ins and outs of animating expressive faces in Spark AR!
We will animate a 3D face using gestures and BlendShapes, use patches and code to increase the range of gesture detection amplifying subtle interactions and also work with reactive animations and additional details to enhance the expressiveness of the users.
